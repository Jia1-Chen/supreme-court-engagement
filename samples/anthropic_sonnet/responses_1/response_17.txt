"score": 4,
"reasoning": "The dissent demonstrates substantial engagement with the majority's reasoning. Justice Alito directly addresses the majority's reinterpretation of Belton, challenges its stare decisis analysis point-by-point (examining reliance, changed circumstances, workability, consistency, and reasoning), and contests the majority's reading of Chimel. The dissent engages with the same precedents (Belton, Thornton, Chimel) and specifically rebuts key majority arguments about police reliance, the scope of the new rule, and constitutional interpretation. However, it doesn't receive a '5' because while it thoroughly challenges the majority's conclusions, it sometimes emphasizes different aspects (like the procedural point that respondent didn't ask for overruling) and introduces some independent concerns about the new rule's practical application that go beyond direct rebuttal. The engagement is strong and sustained throughout, making this a clear example of 'talking with' rather than 'talking past' the majority."
