  "score": 4,
  "reasoning": "The dissent substantially engages with the majority's reasoning. Justice Alito directly addresses the majority's core holding about the 'money-mandating' test under the Tucker Act and the inference of a private right of action. He challenges the majority's framework by pointing to recent Supreme Court precedents (Comcast, Hernández) that restrict the recognition of implied private rights of action. The dissent specifically engages with the majority's interpretation of § 1342's 'shall pay' language and its application of the fair interpretation test. While the dissent does introduce broader concerns about consistency with general jurisprudence on implied rights of action, it maintains substantial focus on the majority's specific reasoning about Tucker Act claims and money-mandating obligations. The dissent cites the same key precedents (Testan, White Mountain Apache, Navajo Nation) and directly responds to the majority's analytical framework, though it argues for supplemental briefing rather than offering a complete alternative resolution. This represents strong but not quite 'thorough' engagement, as the dissent acknowledges that many issues 'have not received much attention' and requests re-argument."
