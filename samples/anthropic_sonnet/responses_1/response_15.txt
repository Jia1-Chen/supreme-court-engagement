  "score": 5,
  "reasoning": "The dissent demonstrates strong and direct engagement with the majority's reasoning. Justice Alito systematically addresses the majority's textual arguments about the meaning of 'notice to appear,' directly challenges the majority's interpretation of 'under' in the statutory language, rebuts the majority's reliance on neighboring statutory provisions (§1229(a)(2) and §1229(b)(1)), and disputes the majority's 'common sense' argument. The dissent explicitly addresses the majority's treatment of definitional language, points out what it views as contradictions in the majority's reasoning (particularly regarding whether §1229(a)(1) is definitional), and engages with the same statutory provisions and practical concerns. Rather than introducing an entirely separate framework, the dissent argues that the majority should have applied Chevron deference but otherwise addresses the interpretive questions on the same terms. The dissent quotes and responds to specific passages from the majority opinion throughout, demonstrating thorough engagement rather than talking past the majority."
