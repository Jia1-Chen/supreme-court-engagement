  "reasoning": "The dissent demonstrates substantial engagement with the majority's reasoning. It directly addresses the majority's core holding about 'legitimate expectation of privacy' in Part I, extensively analyzing the same precedents (Rakas, Jones, Simmons, Jeffers) to argue the majority misinterprets them. The dissent confronts the majority's property vs. privacy distinction head-on, citing the Fourth Amendment's text to argue property interests should suffice for standing. In Part II, it addresses the majority's Brown v. Illinois analysis regarding tainted admissions, disagreeing with the conclusion that statements were acts of free will. The dissent engages with the same legal framework and cases, though it also raises broader concerns about Fourth Amendment erosion in Part III. The engagement is direct and detailed, though some of Part III shifts to broader philosophical concerns about the Fourth Amendment's importance."
