  "reasoning": "The dissent demonstrates substantial engagement with the majority's reasoning. It directly addresses the majority's constitutional analysis and its overruling of Logan Valley, providing detailed rebuttals to the majority's reading of Lloyd Corp. v. Tanner and its reconciliation with Logan Valley. The dissent engages with the same precedents (Marsh, Logan Valley, Lloyd, Central Hardware, Babcock & Wilcox) and challenges the majority's interpretation of how these cases relate to each other. However, the dissent also devotes significant attention to an independent threshold issue—arguing that the case should be decided on purely statutory grounds without reaching the constitutional question at all. This represents a partial shift in focus from direct engagement with the majority's constitutional analysis to a procedural objection about whether the constitutional question should be reached. While this procedural argument is itself a form of engagement (challenging the majority's decision to address the First Amendment issue), it does introduce an independent dimension that prevents this from being a pure point-by-point rebuttal of the majority's constitutional reasoning. The dissent's Section II does affirm the statutory analysis, and Section III provides detailed constitutional counterarguments, making this a strong but not complete engagement."
