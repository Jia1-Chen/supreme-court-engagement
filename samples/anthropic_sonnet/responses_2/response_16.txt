  "score": 4,
  "reasoning": "The dissent substantially engages with the majority's reasoning while also introducing broader due process concerns. Justice Marshall directly addresses the majority's reliance on Ross v. Moffitt, explaining why he disagrees with both that precedent and its application here. He then provides an alternative legal framework (due process) that he argues should apply even if the majority's Sixth Amendment analysis were correct. The dissent also directly rebuts the majority's state action argument in footnote 4, citing Cuyler v. Sullivan to demonstrate why state action is present. While the dissent does introduce independent due process arguments beyond the majority's Sixth Amendment focus, it thoroughly engages with the majority's core reasoning and provides point-by-point rebuttals to key arguments, including the precedential basis and the state action requirement."
