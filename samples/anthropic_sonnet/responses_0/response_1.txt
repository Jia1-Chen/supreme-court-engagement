  "score": 4,
  "reasoning": "The dissent substantially engages with the majority's reasoning. Justice Harlan directly addresses the majority's application of Segal v. Rochelle and Local Loan Co. v. Hunt, arguing that these precedents actually 'tend to support the position of the trustee rather than compel a decision for the bankrupt.' He works within the same legal framework as the majority, citing the same key cases and engaging with the 'fresh start' principle central to the majority's analysis. However, rather than providing a comprehensive rebuttal, he focuses primarily on procedural concerns (arguing the case deserves full-dress treatment rather than summary disposition) and points to factual ambiguities in the record. This represents substantial but not complete engagement, as he acknowledges the case is 'close' without fully developing an alternative legal analysis."
