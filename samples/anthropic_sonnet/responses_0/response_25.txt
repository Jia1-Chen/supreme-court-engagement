"score": 4,
"reasoning": "The dissent substantially engages with the majority's reasoning. It directly addresses the majority's reliance on Alexandria Scrap, distinguishing that case by arguing the Maryland program involved subsidies that didn't create trade barriers, while South Dakota's policy constitutes a 'direct barrier to trade.' The dissent challenges the majority's market participant/market regulator distinction, arguing states cannot be equated with private actors when they respond to political rather than economic concerns. It also rebuts the majority's distinction of natural resources cases (footnote 2) and addresses the 'complex process' argument. However, the dissent does introduce some broader constitutional concerns about economic Balkanization and federalism that go beyond direct rebuttal, preventing a score of 5. Overall, this represents substantial engagement with specific legal arguments and precedents cited by the majority."
