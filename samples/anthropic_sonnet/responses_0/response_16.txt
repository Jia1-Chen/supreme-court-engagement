  "reasoning": "The dissent substantially engages with the majority's reasoning. Justice Marshall directly addresses the majority's reliance on Ross v. Moffitt, explaining both why he believes that precedent was wrongly decided and why it shouldn't control this case. He then offers an alternative due process framework that would reach a different result. Importantly, the dissent also directly rebuts the majority's footnote 4 regarding state action, citing Cuyler v. Sullivan to argue that sufficient state involvement exists. While the dissent does introduce some independent concerns about fairness and the significance of discretionary review, these arguments are presented as part of a coherent rebuttal to the majority's core holdings. The dissent engages with the same legal framework (Sixth Amendment, due process, state action) and directly challenges the majority's application of precedent, demonstrating meaningful dialogue rather than talking past the majority."
