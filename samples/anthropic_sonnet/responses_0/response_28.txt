  "reasoning": "The dissent substantially engages with the majority's reasoning. It directly challenges the majority's core holding about abstention doctrine, specifically addressing the majority's claim that requiring federal adjudication prevents 'added expense' and 'prolonged unlawful denial.' The dissent rebuts this by arguing the opposite is true—that federal jurisdiction creates inefficiency by splitting the case between forums. The dissent also engages with the majority's comity analysis, arguing that 'exceptional circumstances' do exist here. It addresses the majority's treatment of § 2283 and discusses the practical consequences of the majority's interpretation. While the dissent emphasizes different concerns (judicial efficiency, state comity) and reaches opposite conclusions, it does so by directly confronting the majority's framework and specific arguments rather than introducing an entirely separate analytical approach. The engagement is substantial but not exhaustive of every point in the lengthy majority opinion."
