Official Citation: 138 S. Ct. 2105

{
  "score": 5,
  "reasoning": "The dissent demonstrates strong, direct engagement with the majority's reasoning throughout. Justice Alito systematically addresses the majority's textual arguments about 'notice to appear' and 'under section 1229(a),' responds to the majority's interpretation of specific subsections (including §1229(a)(2) and §1229(b)(1)), directly rebuts the majority's 'common sense' argument, and challenges the majority's treatment of statutory purpose. The dissent uses the same statutory provisions, addresses the same precedents (Chevron), and point-by-point contests the majority's conclusions. While the dissent frames the case through Chevron deference (which the majority explicitly rejects as unnecessary), it still engages thoroughly with each element of the majority's textual analysis, even pointing out internal contradictions in the majority's reasoning (e.g., regarding whether omission of other §1229(a)(1) requirements would also void a notice). This is a paradigmatic example of 'talking with' the majority opinion."
