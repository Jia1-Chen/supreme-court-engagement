  "score": 5,
  "reasoning": "The dissent demonstrates strong and direct engagement with the majority's reasoning. It specifically addresses the majority's application of the Rhode Island v. Innis standard for interrogation, challenges the majority's interpretation of the trial court's factual findings, and directly rebuts each of the majority's three main reasons for reversing (lack of police subterfuge, mixed motives, and lack of coercion). The dissent uses the same legal framework (Miranda, Edwards, Innis), cites the same precedents, and systematically confronts the majority's statutory interpretation. It particularly focuses on challenging the majority's conclusion that police conduct was not the 'functional equivalent' of interrogation, which is the central legal issue in the case. The dissent even addresses specific footnotes from the majority opinion, demonstrating thorough engagement with the majority's complete reasoning."
