  "score": 4,
  "reasoning": "The dissent substantially engages with the majority's reasoning. It directly addresses the Alexandria Scrap precedent that forms the foundation of the majority's market participant doctrine, providing a detailed counter-interpretation of that case. The dissent responds to the majority's distinction between market participants and market regulators, arguing that states cannot be presumed to behave like private businesses. It also directly rebuts the majority's attempt to distinguish natural resources cases and challenges the Court's characterization of South Dakota's activity as non-protectionist. The dissent uses the same legal framework and precedents as the majority while reaching opposite conclusions. However, it receives a 4 rather than a 5 because it also introduces some broader federalism concerns and policy arguments about state sovereignty that extend slightly beyond direct rebuttal of the majority's specific points."
