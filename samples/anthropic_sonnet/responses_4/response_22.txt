  "score": 4,
  "reasoning": "The dissent substantially engages with the majority's reasoning. It directly addresses the majority's central argument that FELA cases involving Safety Appliance and Boiler Inspection Acts establish a general principle of absolute liability for statutory violations. The dissent carefully distinguishes these cases, arguing they rest on the 'peculiar relationship' between those specific Acts and the FELA, supported by express congressional intent. The dissent engages with the same precedents (Urie, Wagner, Carter) and challenges the majority's interpretation of them. It also addresses the majority's statutory construction of the Jones Act and challenges the premise that courts should freely develop new liability theories beyond common-law negligence. While the dissent introduces some broader concerns about judicial lawmaking, the core of the opinion directly rebuts the majority's key legal reasoning through detailed analysis of the same cases and statutes. The dissent doesn't merely talk past the majority—it systematically dismantles the majority's logic, though it stops short of the most exhaustive engagement (hence 4 rather than 5)."
