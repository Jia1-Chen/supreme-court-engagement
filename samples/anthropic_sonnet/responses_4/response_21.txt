"score": 4,
"reasoning": "The dissent substantially engages with the majority's reasoning, though it also introduces broader concerns. Stevens directly challenges the majority's reliance on common-law definitions of 'seizure,' arguing this contradicts the expansive interpretations established in Katz and Terry. He addresses the majority's key points about submission being necessary for seizure, the Mendenhall test interpretation, and the common-law arrest framework. The dissent systematically rebuts the majority's conclusions using the same precedents (Katz, Terry, Mendenhall, Chesternut, Brower). However, it also expands beyond direct rebuttal to discuss policy concerns about police conduct and Fourth Amendment purposes more broadly. The engagement is thorough and direct, citing the majority's specific arguments and providing detailed counter-analysis, but the introduction of additional policy considerations and hypothetical scenarios prevents it from being a pure point-by-point rebuttal (score of 5)."
