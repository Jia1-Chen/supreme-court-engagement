  "score": 4,
  "reasoning": "The dissent demonstrates substantial engagement with the majority's reasoning. Justice Alito directly addresses the majority's core holding regarding the 'money-mandating' test under the Tucker Act and challenges its application to infer a private right of action. The dissent engages with the same statutory provisions (§1342), discusses the same Tucker Act framework, and directly responds to the majority's interpretation of precedents like Testan, Sandoval, and cases involving implied rights of action. The dissent also responds to the majority's footnote 12, showing direct dialogue. However, the dissent does not extensively engage with Parts I-III of the majority opinion (explicitly stating agreement for argument's sake), instead focusing primarily on Part IV regarding the Tucker Act remedy. This selective engagement, while substantial on the key issue, prevents a score of 5. The dissent introduces broader concerns about judicial creation of private rights of action and calls for reargument, but these concerns are directly tied to challenging the majority's central holding rather than talking past it."
