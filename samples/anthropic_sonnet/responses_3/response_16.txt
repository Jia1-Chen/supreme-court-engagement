  "score": 4,
  "reasoning": "The dissent substantially engages with the majority's reasoning. Justice Marshall directly addresses the majority's central reliance on Ross v. Moffitt, though he disagrees with that precedent. More importantly, he directly rebuts the majority's two key arguments: (1) that there's no Sixth Amendment violation without a constitutional right to counsel, and (2) the majority's state action argument in footnote 4. Marshall specifically invokes Cuyler v. Sullivan to counter the state action claim, arguing that the State is implicated in post-trial proceedings just as in trials. He also advances a due process argument as an alternative basis for relief. While the dissent does introduce some broader concerns about fairness, it primarily focuses on directly rebutting the majority's specific legal reasoning and precedential analysis."
