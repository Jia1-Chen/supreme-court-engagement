  "reasoning": "The dissent substantially engages with the majority's reasoning. It directly addresses the majority's interpretation of Rhode Island v. Innis and the 'functional equivalent' test for interrogation, disputes the majority's reading of the factual record (particularly regarding advance warning and police intent), and challenges the majority's key conclusions point-by-point. The dissent quotes the same precedents (Miranda, Innis, Edwards) and applies the same legal framework while reaching opposite conclusions. It specifically rebuts the majority's three main arguments: (1) lack of police subterfuge, (2) legitimate security concerns, and (3) lack of coercion felt by the suspect. While the dissent emphasizes police intent somewhat more than the majority and includes concerns about appellate deference to state court factual findings, these represent differences in emphasis rather than talking past the majority. The dissent is clearly in dialogue with the majority opinion throughout, though it also raises some broader institutional concerns about Supreme Court review of state court fact-finding."
