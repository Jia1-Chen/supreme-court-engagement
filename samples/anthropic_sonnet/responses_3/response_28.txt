  "reasoning": "The dissent substantially engages with the majority's reasoning. It directly addresses the majority's core holding about abstention doctrine and the 'exceptional circumstances' standard. The dissent challenges the majority's application of facts to this standard, arguing the opposite conclusion—that exceptional circumstances DO exist here. It directly rebuts the majority's claims about efficiency and expense, arguing the majority's approach actually creates MORE delay and complexity by splitting the case between federal and state courts. The dissent also engages with the majority's comity analysis and addresses the § 2283 issue. While the dissent emphasizes practical concerns about judicial administration that the majority downplays, it does so while directly engaging the majority's legal framework and factual assertions rather than operating from an entirely separate analytical structure. The engagement is substantial but not quite 'strong' because the dissent focuses somewhat more on practical consequences than on detailed rebuttal of the majority's precedential analysis."
