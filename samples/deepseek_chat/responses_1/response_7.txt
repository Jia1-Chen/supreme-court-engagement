  "score": 4,
  "reasoning": "The dissent substantially engages with the majority's reasoning by directly addressing the due process and notice arguments, citing the same precedents (United States v. Balint), and challenging the majority's distinction between active and passive conduct. However, it also introduces broader concerns about the decision's impact on existing legislation and frames it as an isolated deviation rather than fully rebutting the specific application to registration laws."
