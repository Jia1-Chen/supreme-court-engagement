    "reasoning": "Justice Thomas's dissent demonstrates substantial engagement with the majority's reasoning by directly addressing the statutory interpretation of §§ 848(q)(4)(B) and 2251, rebutting the majority's reliance on § 848(q)(9) and practical considerations, and emphasizing textual analysis over policy. The dissent systematically counters the majority's key points about when a 'proceeding' commences and the interplay between counsel appointment and stay jurisdiction, while also aligning with Justice O'Connor's concurrence/dissent. However, it occasionally shifts to broader federalism concerns, slightly reducing the focus on pure rebuttal."
