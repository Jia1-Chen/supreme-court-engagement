{
  "score": 4,
  "reasoning": "The dissent engages substantially with the majority's reasoning by directly addressing Belton's bright-line rule, challenging the majority's reinterpretation, and critiquing the new two-part test. It responds to key points about stare decisis, reliance interests, and workability, while also introducing broader concerns about doctrinal stability and practical implementation."
