  "score": 4,
  "reasoning": "The dissent directly engages with the majority's reasoning by addressing key precedents (Buck v. Jewell-LaSalle, Fortnightly, Teleprompter), critiques the majority's 'functional analysis' approach, and argues that the respondent's commercial use of broadcasts constitutes performance under existing case law. However, it also emphasizes legislative solutions and broader policy concerns, slightly shifting focus from pure legal rebuttal."
