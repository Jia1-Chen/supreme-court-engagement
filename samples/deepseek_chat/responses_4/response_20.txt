{
  "score": 4,
  "reasoning": "The dissent engages substantially with the majority's reasoning by directly addressing key legal points, including the materiality standard under §1451(a), the interpretation of §1101(f)(6), and the majority's statutory analysis. It cites the same precedents (e.g., Fedorenko) and statutory provisions, offering rebuttals to the majority's conclusions on materiality and procurement. However, it also introduces broader concerns about the case's factual context and the admissibility of evidence, which slightly shifts focus from pure legal dialogue."
