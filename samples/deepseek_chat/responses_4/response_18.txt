Official Citation: 549 U.S. 47

{
  "score": 5,
  "reasoning": "The dissent demonstrates strong engagement by directly addressing the majority's core textual arguments, statutory interpretation methodology, and specific examples. Justice Thomas systematically rebuts the majority's reading of 'felony punishable under the Controlled Substances Act,' challenges the majority's reliance on ordinary meaning of 'trafficking,' points out inconsistencies in the majority's treatment of possession offenses, and engages with the same statutory provisions and precedents cited by the majority."
