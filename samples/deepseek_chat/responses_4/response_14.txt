Official Citation: 481 U.S. 520

{
  "score": 4,
  "reasoning": "The dissent demonstrates substantial engagement by directly addressing the majority's key legal framework (Rhode Island v. Innis), rebutting the majority's application of the 'functional equivalent' test to the facts, and challenging the majority's characterization of police intent and suspect perception. However, it partially shifts focus to factual disputes about police warnings and introduces broader concerns about this Court's certiorari discretion, preventing a perfect score."
