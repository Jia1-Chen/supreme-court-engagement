  "score": 4,
  "reasoning": "The dissent engages substantially with the majority's reasoning by directly addressing the statutory interpretation of 'under color of law,' critiquing the majority's reliance on Classic, Screws, and Williams precedents, and examining the same legislative history. However, it also shifts focus to broader federalism concerns and the proper role of federal courts, which reduces the thoroughness of the rebuttal."
