  "score": 5,
  "reasoning": "Justice Scalia's dissent demonstrates strong engagement by directly addressing all three of the majority's key arguments: (1) he challenges the characterization of §107 as creating only an 'implied' right of action, (2) he rebuts the 'explicit authorization' requirement by arguing the statutory language is sufficiently clear, and (3) he directly contests the majority's narrow interpretation of 'enforcement activities.' The dissent systematically responds to each point using the same statutory provisions and precedents, while also addressing the majority's footnote arguments about statutory construction."
