    "score": 5,
    "reasoning": "The dissent demonstrates strong engagement by directly addressing the majority's textual analysis, statutory interpretation, and practical arguments. Justice Alito systematically rebuts the majority's reading of 'under section 1229(a),' challenges the majority's definitional approach to §1229(a)(1), engages with the same statutory provisions and precedents, and directly responds to the majority's contextual and common-sense arguments. The dissent maintains a focused dialogue on the core interpretive questions rather than introducing unrelated frameworks."
