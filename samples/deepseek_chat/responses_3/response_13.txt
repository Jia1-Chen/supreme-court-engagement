  "score": 4,
  "reasoning": "The dissent demonstrates substantial engagement by directly addressing the majority's historical analysis, statutory interpretation of 'under color of law,' and precedent (Classic, Screws, Williams), while offering a competing legislative history interpretation. However, it also introduces broader federalism concerns and policy arguments beyond the majority's immediate reasoning."
