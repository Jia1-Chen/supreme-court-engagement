    "reasoning": "The dissent demonstrates substantial engagement by directly addressing the majority's core reasoning about extending FELA absolute liability principles to Jones Act cases, systematically analyzing the same precedents (Layton, Gotschall, Davis, Swinson, Coray, Urie), and providing detailed counterarguments about the special relationship between FELA and specific safety statutes. However, it also introduces broader concerns about judicial role and statutory interpretation that extend beyond direct rebuttal of the majority's arguments."
