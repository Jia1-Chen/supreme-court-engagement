    "score": 5,
    "reasoning": "Justice Thomas's dissent demonstrates strong engagement by directly addressing the majority's statutory interpretation of §§ 848(q)(4)(B) and 2251, rebutting the majority's reliance on § 848(q)(9) and policy arguments, and emphasizing textual analysis and the habeas statute's established framework. The dissent systematically counters the majority's reasoning, cites the same precedents, and highlights procedural inconsistencies, showing a thorough and meaningful dialogue."
