{
  "score": 4,
  "reasoning": "The dissent directly engages with the majority's reasoning by addressing key precedents (Buck v. Jewell-LaSalle, Fortnightly, Teleprompter), critiques the majority's 'functional analysis' approach, and rebuts the characterization of Aiken as a 'passive beneficiary.' It also discusses statutory interpretation and legislative intent, though it shifts focus to broader concerns about congressional action."
