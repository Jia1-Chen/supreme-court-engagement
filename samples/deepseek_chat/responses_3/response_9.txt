  "score": 4,
  "reasoning": "Justice Scalia's dissent directly engages with the majority's core reasoning by challenging the hybrid approach to fee reasonableness, addressing the same statutory text and precedents (including Hensley v. Eckerhart), and rebutting the majority's historical and practical arguments. However, it also introduces broader concerns about judicial administrability and contract theory that partially shift focus from the majority's framework."
