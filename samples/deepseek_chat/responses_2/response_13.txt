{
  "score": 4,
  "reasoning": "The dissent engages substantially with the majority's reasoning by directly addressing the statutory interpretation of 'under color of law,' critiquing the majority's reliance on Classic, Screws, and Williams precedents, and examining the same legislative history and debates. However, it also introduces broader federalism concerns and policy arguments about the role of federal courts versus state courts, which shifts some focus away from direct rebuttal of the majority's specific points."
