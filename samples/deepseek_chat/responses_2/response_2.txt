Official Citation: 437 U.S. 298

{
  "score": 5,
  "reasoning": "The dissent demonstrates strong engagement by directly addressing the majority's core reasoning about statutory interpretation of §7602, challenging the 'institutional good faith' standard as unworkable, and advocating for the bright-line Donaldson test. It systematically rebuts the majority's legal framework while citing the same precedents and statutory provisions."
