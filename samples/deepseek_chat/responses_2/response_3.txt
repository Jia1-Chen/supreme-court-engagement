{
  "score": 4,
  "reasoning": "The dissent engages substantially with the majority's reasoning by directly addressing the extension of Younger to civil proceedings, critiquing the majority's 'in aid of and closely related to criminal statutes' test, and challenging the new exhaustion requirement for §1983 claims. It references shared precedents like Mitchum v. Foster and Monroe v. Pape to rebut the majority's conclusions, though it also introduces broader concerns about federalism and congressional intent that shift focus slightly from the core legal arguments."
