{
  "score": 4,
  "reasoning": "The dissent directly engages with the majority's reasoning by challenging its reliance on Fortnightly and Teleprompter, distinguishing the facts from those cases, and emphasizing the relevance of Buck v. Jewell-LaSalle. It addresses the majority's statutory interpretation and functional analysis, while also introducing broader concerns about legislative action and equitable principles, though it shifts some focus to policy arguments."
