  "score": 4,
  "reasoning": "Justice Rehnquist's dissent demonstrates substantial engagement by directly addressing the majority's reliance on Maryland v. Wirtz and United States v. California, critiquing the analytical foundation of these precedents, and challenging the majority's interpretation of the Tenth Amendment's role in limiting federal power. However, it also introduces broader federalism concerns that extend beyond the immediate statutory and constitutional arguments of the majority."
