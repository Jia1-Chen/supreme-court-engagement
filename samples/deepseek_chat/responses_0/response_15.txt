    "score": 5,
    "reasoning": "The dissent demonstrates strong engagement by directly addressing the majority's core textual arguments, statutory interpretation methodology, and practical concerns. Justice Alito systematically rebuts the majority's reading of 'notice to appear under section 1229(a),' challenges the majority's definitional approach to §1229(a)(1), engages with the same statutory provisions and precedents, and directly counters the majority's practical arguments about administrative feasibility. The dissent maintains consistent focus on the same legal framework while offering competing reasonable interpretations of the statutory text."
