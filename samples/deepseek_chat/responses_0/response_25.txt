{
  "score": 5,
  "reasoning": "The dissent demonstrates strong engagement by directly addressing the majority's core reasoning, particularly the market participant doctrine from Hughes v. Alexandria Scrap Corp. It systematically rebuts the majority's application of this doctrine to cement sales, distinguishes Alexandria Scrap on grounds that South Dakota's policy creates a trade barrier, and engages with the same precedents and constitutional principles. The dissent also counters the majority's arguments about cement not being a natural resource and the state's role, showing thorough, point-by-point dialogue."
