{
  "score": 5,
  "reasoning": "Justice Souter's dissent thoroughly engages with the majority's reasoning by directly addressing its key arguments on viewpoint discrimination, statutory interpretation, and applicable precedents like Rosenberger and Rust. The dissent provides a detailed rebuttal, citing the same legal framework and legislative history, and systematically counters the majority's conclusions, demonstrating strong and meaningful dialogue rather than talking past."
