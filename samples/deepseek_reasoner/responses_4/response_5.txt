{
  "score": 4,
  "reasoning": "The dissent engages substantially with the majority's reasoning by directly addressing key legal arguments, such as the application of Taylor v. Louisiana, the definition of 'systematic exclusion,' and the blending of Sixth Amendment and equal protection doctrines. It cites the same precedents and provides a rebuttal to the majority's prima facie test and justification analysis. However, it also introduces broader concerns about administrative burdens and policy implications, which slightly shifts the focus away from pure legal engagement."
