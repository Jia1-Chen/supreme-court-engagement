{
  "score": 4,
  "reasoning": "The dissent substantially engages with the majority's reasoning by directly addressing key points, such as the interpretation of § 2 Seventh of the Railway Labor Act and the role of courts in permitting changes to collective bargaining agreements. It cites the same precedent (Steele v. Louisville & N. R. Co.) and provides a rebuttal based on statutory language and congressional intent. However, it also introduces broader policy concerns about strike prevention and court intervention, which slightly shifts focus beyond a purely detailed legal rebuttal."
