Official Citation: 420 U.S. 592

{
  "score": 4,
  "reasoning": "The dissent engages substantially with the majority's reasoning by directly addressing key points such as the extension of Younger to civil proceedings, the characterization of the nuisance action as related to criminal statutes, and the exhaustion requirement. It cites many of the same precedents (e.g., Younger, Dombrowski, Mitchum) and provides a rebuttal based on historical and statutory interpretation, though it also introduces broader concerns about federal jurisdiction under §1983."
