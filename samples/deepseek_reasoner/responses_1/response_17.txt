  "score": 5,
  "reasoning": "The dissent directly engages with the majority's key arguments, including the reinterpretation of Belton, stare decisis, reliance interests, and the practicality of the new rule. It cites the same precedents (Chimel, Belton, Thornton) and provides a detailed rebuttal, demonstrating meaningful dialogue rather than ignoring or shifting focus away from the majority's reasoning."
