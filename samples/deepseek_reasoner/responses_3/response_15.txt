Official Citation: 138 S. Ct. 2105

{
  "score": 5,
  "reasoning": "The dissent directly and thoroughly engages with the majority's reasoning, addressing specific legal arguments such as the meaning of 'under' in the stop-time rule, the interpretation of §1229(a)(1), statutory cross-references, and practical concerns. It cites the same precedents (e.g., Chevron, Kirtsaeng, Becker v. Montgomery) and provides a detailed rebuttal, demonstrating meaningful dialogue without ignoring key points or relying on a separate framework."
