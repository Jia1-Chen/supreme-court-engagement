{
  "score": 4,
  "reasoning": "The dissent engages substantially with the majority's reasoning by directly addressing key legal arguments, such as the fair-cross-section requirement, systematic exclusion, and the burden of proof, while citing the same precedents (e.g., Taylor v. Louisiana). However, it also introduces broader concerns about judicial administration and equal protection, which slightly shifts focus from a purely detailed rebuttal."
