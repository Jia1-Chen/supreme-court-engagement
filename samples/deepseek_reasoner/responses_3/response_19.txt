  "reasoning": "Justice Scalia's dissent directly engages with the majority's reasoning by addressing specific legal arguments, such as the rationality of the NLRB's no-presumption approach and policy considerations, cites the same precedents (e.g., Service Electric and Leveld Wholesale), and provides a detailed rebuttal to key points like the inherent conflict between strikers and replacements, demonstrating thorough and meaningful dialogue."
