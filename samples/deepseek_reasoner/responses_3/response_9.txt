  "score": 4,
  "reasoning": "Justice Scalia's dissent substantially engages with the majority's reasoning by directly addressing key points, such as the interpretation of 'reasonable fee' under § 406(b), the inappropriateness of the hybrid approach, and the use of the lodestar method. He cites the same precedent (e.g., Hensley v. Eckerhart) and rebuts the majority's historical and practical arguments, though he introduces broader concerns about clarity and consistency, which slightly shifts focus."
