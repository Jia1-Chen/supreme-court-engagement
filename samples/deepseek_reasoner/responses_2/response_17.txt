{
  "score": 5,
  "reasoning": "The dissent by Justice Alito demonstrates strong engagement with the majority opinion by directly addressing its key arguments, including the reinterpretation of Belton, the stare decisis analysis, and the new two-part rule. It cites the same precedents (e.g., Chimel, Belton, Thornton, Dickerson) and provides a detailed rebuttal, systematically countering the majority's reasoning on reliance interests, workability, and consistency without shifting focus to unrelated issues."
