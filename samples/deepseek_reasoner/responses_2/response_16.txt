  "score": 5,
  "reasoning": "The dissent thoroughly engages with the majority's reasoning by directly addressing its reliance on Ross v. Moffitt, challenging the precedent, and rebutting the state action argument with Cuyler v. Sullivan. It provides a detailed alternative due process analysis, demonstrating meaningful dialogue without shifting focus away from key points."
