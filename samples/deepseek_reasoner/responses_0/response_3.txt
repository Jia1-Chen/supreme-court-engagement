Official Citation: 420 U.S. 592

{
  "score": 5,
  "reasoning": "The dissent directly engages with the majority's key arguments, addressing the extension of Younger to civil proceedings, the requirement to exhaust state appellate remedies, and the comity and federalism principles. It cites the same precedents (e.g., Younger, Monroe v. Pape, Mitchum v. Foster) and provides a detailed rebuttal rooted in statutory interpretation and historical context, demonstrating meaningful dialogue rather than talking past the majority."
