{
  "score": 5,
  "reasoning": "The dissent thoroughly engages with the majority's reasoning by directly addressing key points such as the reinterpretation of Belton, stare decisis, reliance interests, and the practicality of the new rule. It cites the same precedents (e.g., Belton, Thornton, Chimel) and provides a detailed rebuttal, demonstrating meaningful dialogue rather than talking past."
