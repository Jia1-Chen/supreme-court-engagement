{
  "score": 4,
  "reasoning": "Justice Scalia's dissent substantially engages with the majority's reasoning by directly addressing key points, such as the hybrid approach to fee calculation and the interpretation of 'reasonable fee,' and cites shared precedents like Hensley v. Eckerhart. However, it also introduces broader concerns about the non-negotiated nature of contingent-fee agreements and the impracticality of the majority's framework, which slightly shifts focus from a purely responsive rebuttal."
