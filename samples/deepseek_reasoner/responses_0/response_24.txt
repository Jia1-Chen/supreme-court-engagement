  "score": 4,
  "reasoning": "The dissent directly engages with the majority's key arguments, including the interpretation of Section 2 Seventh of the Railway Labor Act, the concept of self-help, and the role of courts in authorizing changes to collective bargaining agreements. It cites the same statutory provisions and precedents (e.g., Steele v. Louisville & N. R. Co.) and provides a detailed rebuttal of the majority's reasoning. However, it also shifts focus to broader concerns about congressional intent, expert agency supervision, and the practical effects on strikes, which prevents it from being a thorough, line-by-line engagement."
