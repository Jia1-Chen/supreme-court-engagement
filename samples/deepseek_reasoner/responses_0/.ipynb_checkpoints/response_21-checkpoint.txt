  "score": 5,
  "reasoning": "The dissent thoroughly engages with the majority's reasoning by directly addressing key arguments, citing the same precedents (e.g., Terry, Mendenhall, Katz), and providing a detailed rebuttal on the definition of seizure, common law interpretation, and the Mendenhall test, demonstrating meaningful dialogue rather than ignoring or shifting focus away from the majority's points."
