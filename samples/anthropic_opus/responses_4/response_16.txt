  "score": 4,
  "reasoning": "The dissent directly engages with the majority's core holding based on Ross v. Moffitt, explicitly stating disagreement with both Ross itself and its application here. Justice Marshall addresses the majority's state action argument in detail (responding to footnote 4), citing Cuyler v. Sullivan to counter the majority's position. The dissent acknowledges the majority's Sixth Amendment analysis but offers an alternative due process theory that directly responds to why respondent should still have relief despite Ross. While the dissent does introduce some broader concerns about fairness and the importance of discretionary review, it maintains substantial engagement with the majority's specific legal reasoning throughout."
