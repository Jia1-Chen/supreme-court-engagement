  "score": 4,
  "reasoning": "The dissent directly engages with the majority's core legal arguments on both main issues. On the materiality standard for § 1451(a), White accepts the majority's test but disputes its application, arguing the majority wrongly excludes visa proceedings and misinterprets what facts should be considered material. On § 1101(f)(6), White agrees with the majority that materiality is not required but argues the majority errs in remanding rather than affirming based on the clear evidence. Throughout, White addresses the same statutory provisions, precedents (Chaunt, Fedorenko), and factual findings, offering detailed rebuttals while maintaining focus on the majority's reasoning rather than introducing independent frameworks."
