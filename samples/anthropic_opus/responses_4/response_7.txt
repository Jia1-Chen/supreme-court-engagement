  "score": 2,
  "reasoning": "The dissent minimally engages with the majority's core due process argument about notice requirements. While Frankfurter acknowledges the majority's distinction between 'doing and not doing,' he dismisses it as a formalistic Year Book distinction rather than substantively addressing why notice shouldn't be required for passive conduct. The dissent primarily focuses on arguing that many existing registration laws would be invalidated (a slippery slope argument) and comparing the penalty's severity to other crimes, rather than directly confronting the majority's central reasoning about why this particular ordinance violates due process by punishing wholly passive, unknowing conduct without any opportunity to comply."
