  "score": 4,
  "reasoning": "The dissent directly and thoroughly engages with the majority's core arguments. Souter systematically addresses the majority's three main defenses of the statute: (1) that the language is too imprecise to constitute viewpoint discrimination, (2) that compliance through diverse panels satisfies the statute, and (3) that the provision merely adds 'considerations' without mandating specific outcomes. The dissent cites the same precedents (Rosenberger, Rust, Regan) and analyzes the same statutory language, providing detailed rebuttals to each point. While the dissent also introduces broader First Amendment concerns about viewpoint discrimination in government subsidies, this additional discussion serves to contextualize rather than avoid the majority's reasoning."
