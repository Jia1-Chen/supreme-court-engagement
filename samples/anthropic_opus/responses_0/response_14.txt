  "reasoning": "The dissent directly engages with the majority's core reasoning about whether police conduct constituted 'interrogation' under Rhode Island v. Innis. Both opinions focus on the same legal standard (whether police conduct was 'reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response'), cite the same precedents (Miranda, Edwards, Innis), and analyze the same factual issues (the officers' intent, the recording of the conversation, and whether this was the functional equivalent of interrogation). The dissent explicitly addresses and rebuts the majority's three main arguments: (1) the lack of 'subterfuge,' (2) the legitimate security concerns, and (3) whether Mauro felt coerced. While the dissent also raises broader concerns about police overreaching and deference to state court findings, the core of its argument directly confronts the majority's application of the Innis standard to these facts."
