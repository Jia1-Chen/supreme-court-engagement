  "score": 4,
  "reasoning": "The dissent directly engages with the majority's core statutory interpretation arguments. Thomas systematically addresses the majority's reading of 'felony punishable under the [CSA],' responds to their textual analysis of § 924(c)(2), confronts their concerns about state-federal disparities, and offers counterarguments about statutory superfluity. While the dissent also introduces some independent arguments (like the Commerce Clause analogy), it primarily focuses on rebutting the majority's specific reasoning about whether state felonies qualify as 'drug trafficking crimes' under the federal statute."
