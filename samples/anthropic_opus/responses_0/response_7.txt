  "reasoning": "The dissent minimally engages with the majority's core due process argument about notice requirements for passive conduct. While Frankfurter acknowledges the majority's distinction between 'doing and not doing,' he dismisses it as irrelevant rather than substantively rebutting why notice shouldn't be required for passive registration failures. The dissent focuses instead on arguing that many strict liability statutes exist without knowledge requirements, but doesn't directly address the majority's specific reasoning about why this particular ordinance - involving wholly passive conduct with criminal penalties - requires actual knowledge to satisfy due process. The dissent's main thrust is that the decision will be an 'isolated deviation' rather than engaging with the constitutional principles the majority articulates."
