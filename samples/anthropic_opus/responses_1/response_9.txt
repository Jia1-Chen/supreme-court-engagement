  "reasoning": "The dissent shows minimal engagement with the majority's reasoning. While Justice Scalia directly addresses the majority's hybrid approach of starting with contingent-fee agreements then adjusting for reasonableness, he largely talks past the majority by advocating for a completely different framework (pure lodestar method). He acknowledges the majority's position but immediately dismisses it as 'irrational' and 'incompatible,' then pivots to his own independent theory about ex ante versus ex post reasonableness determinations. The dissent doesn't engage substantively with the majority's statutory interpretation, legislative history analysis, or policy arguments about preserving contingent-fee agreements in Social Security cases."
