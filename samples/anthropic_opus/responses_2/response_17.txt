  "score": 4,
  "reasoning": "The dissent directly engages with the majority's core arguments about Belton's interpretation, stare decisis, and the Chimel rationale. Justice Alito systematically addresses the majority's reasoning about police reliance, the bright-line rule, and constitutional precedent. While the dissent does introduce some independent concerns about officer safety and workability, it primarily focuses on rebutting the majority's specific legal arguments about overruling Belton and the proper reading of Chimel. The dissent quotes and responds to specific passages from the majority opinion, demonstrating substantial dialogue rather than talking past the majority's analysis."
