Official Citation: 138 S. Ct. 2105

{
  "score": 4,
  "reasoning": "The dissent directly engages with the majority's core arguments about statutory interpretation, particularly regarding whether a notice missing time-and-place information triggers the stop-time rule. Alito specifically addresses the majority's textual arguments about § 1229(a), disputes their 'common sense' reasoning, responds to their interpretation of 'under,' and rebuts their reading of neighboring provisions. While the dissent also introduces the broader Chevron deference framework as an independent argument, the bulk of the opinion systematically addresses and attempts to refute the majority's specific statutory interpretations, making this substantial engagement rather than talking past."
