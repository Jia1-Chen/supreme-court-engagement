  "score": 4,
  "reasoning": "The dissent directly engages with the majority's core statutory interpretation arguments. Thomas specifically addresses the majority's reading of 'felony punishable under the CSA,' responds to their textual analysis of §924(c)(2), contests their concerns about state-federal disparities, and offers counterarguments using the same statutory provisions. While the dissent also raises some independent points (like the Commerce Clause comparison), it primarily focuses on rebutting the majority's specific interpretive moves regarding whether state felonies can qualify as 'drug trafficking crimes' under federal law."
