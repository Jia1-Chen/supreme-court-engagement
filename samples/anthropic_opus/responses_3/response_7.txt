  "score": 2,
  "reasoning": "The dissent minimally engages with the majority's core due process argument about notice requirements. While Frankfurter briefly acknowledges the majority's distinction between acts and omissions ('doing and not doing'), he dismisses it as an improper constitutional line rather than addressing the majority's detailed analysis about why notice is essential for passive conduct. The dissent primarily makes an independent argument about the widespread existence of strict liability laws and warns about broader implications, but fails to directly rebut the majority's specific reasoning about why this registration law violates due process when applied to someone with no knowledge of the requirement."
