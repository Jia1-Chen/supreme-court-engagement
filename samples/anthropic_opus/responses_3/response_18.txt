{
  "score": 4,
  "reasoning": "The dissent directly engages with the majority's core statutory interpretation arguments. Thomas systematically addresses the majority's reading of 'felony punishable under the CSA,' disputes their textual analysis of § 924(c)(2), responds to their concerns about anomalies, and offers counter-interpretations of the same provisions. While the dissent also introduces some independent arguments (like the Commerce Clause critique), the predominant focus is a point-by-point rebuttal of the majority's reasoning using the same statutory framework and precedents."
