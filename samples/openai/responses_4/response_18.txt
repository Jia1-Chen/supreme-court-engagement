Official Citation: 549 U.S. 47

{"score": 5, "reasoning": "The dissent directly engages the majority’s core reasoning on the meaning of “felony punishable under the CSA,” arguing for a plain-text reading of §924(c)(2) (“any felony”) that includes state felonies, and counters the majority’s contextual arguments. It addresses the same statutory provisions (8 U.S.C. §1101(a)(43)(B), 18 U.S.C. §924(c)(2), §924(c)(1)(A), Title 18’s felony definition §3559(a), and the INA’s penultimate sentence), responds to the majority’s concerns about surplusage, ordinary meaning of ‘illicit trafficking,’ state-law variability, and the marijuana and quantity anomalies, and even rebuts specific footnotes. This is a detailed, point-by-point rebuttal demonstrating strong dialogue with the majority."}
