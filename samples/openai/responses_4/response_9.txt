{"score": 5, "reasoning": "Strong engagement. The dissent directly confronts the majority’s core holding (starting from contingent-fee agreements vs. lodestar), critiques the majority’s hybrid reasonableness review, and proposes lodestar as the only coherent reading of “reasonable fee.” It responds to specific majority points—addressing the 1965 enactment timing and lodestar’s later development, the §406(a) agency-stage cap and analogy, adhesion-like nature of SSA fee contracts, and the delay/windfall concern—while citing many of the same precedents (e.g., Hensley, Dague) and even referencing the majority’s pages. This reflects a detailed, point-by-point rebuttal rather than talking past the majority."}
