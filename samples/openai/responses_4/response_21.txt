{"score": 5, "reasoning": "Strong engagement. The dissent directly challenges the majority’s core definition of “seizure,” arguing against the common-law-arrest framing and instead applying Katz, Terry, Mendenhall, Delgado, Royer, Chesternut, Jacobsen—the same doctrinal touchstones the majority discusses. It squarely contests the majority’s view that Mendenhall provides only a necessary (not sufficient) condition, addresses Brower and Hester as the majority’s key precedents, and debates policy implications and the exclusionary rule on the same terms. It also responds to the majority’s common-law analysis by introducing the attempted-arrest distinction. Overall, the dissent is in sustained dialogue with the majority’s reasoning and authorities."}
