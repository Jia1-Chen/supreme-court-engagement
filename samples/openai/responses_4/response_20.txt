Official Citation: 485 U.S. 759

{"score": 5, "reasoning": "Strong engagement. The dissent accepts the majority’s core legal standards (agrees with the ‘natural tendency to influence’ materiality test under §1451(a) and that §1101(f)(6) has no materiality requirement), then directly contests the majority’s applications: (1) it argues visa-stage misrepresentations can be considered under §1451(a) and distinguishes the majority’s literacy hypothetical; (2) it contends that materiality can rest on the fact of the discrepancy itself prompting investigation, citing record evidence and regulations; and (3) it addresses the remand issues under §1101(f)(6) (what counts as “testimony” and the “purpose of obtaining benefits” intent), arguing both are satisfied as a matter of law. The dissent cites the same statutes and precedents (Chaunt, Fedorenko, §§1451(a), 1101(f)(6)) and provides targeted rebuttals. This is a point-by-point dialogue, not talking past the majority."}
