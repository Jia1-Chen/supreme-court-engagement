Official Citation: 448 U.S. 98

{"score": 4, "reasoning": "The dissent substantially engages the majority’s core holdings. It directly contests the majority’s Rakas/Katz-based expectation-of-privacy analysis by arguing that possessory interests in the seized items (citing Jeffers, Jones, Simmons) suffice under the Fourth Amendment’s protection of “effects,” and rebuts the majority’s treatment of property concepts. On the fruit-of-the-poisonous-tree issue, it disputes the majority’s characterization of the admission as “spontaneous,” tracing a causal chain from the assumed illegal detention to the illegal search to the admission. However, it does not walk through the full Brown v. Illinois multi-factor analysis as the majority does, and it does not address the search-incident-to-arrest holding directly, instead shifting to broader policy concerns. Hence, strong but not complete engagement."}
