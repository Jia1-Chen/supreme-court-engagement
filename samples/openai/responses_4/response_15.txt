Official Citation: 138 S. Ct. 2105

{"score": 5, "reasoning": "Strong engagement. The dissent directly addresses the majority’s textual analysis and context, disputing the meaning of “under” in §1229b(d)(1), the definitional reading of §1229(a)(1), and the relevance of §1229(a)(2) and §1229(b)(1). It critiques the majority’s treatment of Chevron, responds to the same statutory provisions and precedents, and offers detailed counterarguments on statutory history and practical consequences. This is a point-by-point rebuttal rather than talking past the majority."}
