Official Citation: 384 U.S. 238

{"score": 5, "reasoning": "The dissent squarely confronts the majority’s core holding that courts may authorize “reasonably necessary” deviations from existing agreements during a strike. It accepts the majority’s premise that §2 Seventh forbids unilateral carrier changes, but argues the Court impermissibly reads a judicial exception into the statute. It cites the same statutory provisions (§2 Seventh, §5 First, §6), addresses the majority’s public-duty rationale, and rebuts the self-help framework by insisting operation must continue only under the existing contract except on bargained subjects. It also invokes related precedents (e.g., Steele; Elgin) and policy consequences to challenge the majority’s approach. This is a direct, detailed engagement with the majority’s reasoning."}
