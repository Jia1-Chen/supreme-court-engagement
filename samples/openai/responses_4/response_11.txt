Official Citation: 467 U.S. 380

{"score":4, "reasoning":"The dissent directly contests the majority’s core interpretations—especially the ‘amount of power’ (quantity vs. quality/interruptibility) debate—using the same statutory provisions (§§ 5(d)(1)(A), 5(d)(1)(B), 5(a), and definitions) and legislative history, and it challenges the majority’s deference rationale. It also addresses the second-quartile tradeoff and the exchange program linkage. However, it does not fully engage with certain key strands of the majority’s reasoning, such as the argument that preference does not apply to statutorily mandated initial contracts (administrative allocation vs. statutory allocation) and the §5(g)(7) “deemed sufficient resources” point. Hence, substantial but not complete engagement."}
