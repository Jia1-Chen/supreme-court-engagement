{"score": 5, "reasoning": "The dissent directly engages the majority’s rationale at every turn. It accepts the shared baseline (no wrongful-death action on unseaworthiness), focuses on the Jones Act/FELA framework, and contests the majority’s extension of strict-liability principles from Safety Appliance/Boiler Inspection Act cases. It cites and analyzes the same precedents (Layton, Gotschall, Davis, Swinson, Coray, Urie, O’Donnell, Carter, Wagner), argues the special in pari materia relationship of those Acts to FELA, and rebuts the majority’s dismissal of the Acts’ nature and purpose as irrelevant. It also addresses the statutory text (§§ 1, 3, 4 of FELA; 33 U.S.C. §§ 157–158), purpose (collision prevention vs. employee safety), and the majority’s policy premise about evolving remedies. This is a thorough, point-by-point counter, demonstrating strong dialogue with the majority."}
