Official Citation: 355 U.S. 225

{"score": 4, "reasoning": "The dissent directly challenges the majority’s core rationale that due process requires knowledge (or probability of knowledge) for a purely passive failure-to-register offense. It engages the strict-liability framework, cites Balint (also cited by the majority), disputes the act/omission line the majority draws, and critiques the majority’s use of Holmes. It also notes the appellant’s local conviction/residency to undercut any notice concern. However, it does not grapple in detail with the majority’s civil-notice precedents (Mullane, Covey, Walker) or the majority’s specific “probability of knowledge” standard, and it avoids a fuller engagement with the majority’s distinctions among regulatory contexts. Hence substantial but not exhaustive engagement."}
