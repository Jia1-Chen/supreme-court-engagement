Official Citation: 524 U.S. 569

{"score": 5, "reasoning": "The dissent directly engages the majority’s core holdings point by point. It contests the majority’s characterization of §954(d)(1) as merely hortatory, argues the provision is inherently viewpoint-based, rebuts the panel-diversity compliance theory, and squarely addresses the subsidy context by distinguishing government-as-speaker/buyer and applying Rosenberger rather than Rust. It also engages the majority’s facial challenge analysis, invoking overbreadth and chilling effects, and concedes vagueness while explaining why overbreadth controls. The dissent cites and analyzes the same precedents (Rosenberger, Rust, Regan, Lamb’s Chapel, R.A.V., Pico, etc.), offering detailed rebuttals to the majority’s interpretations. This is strong, sustained dialogue with the majority’s reasoning."}
