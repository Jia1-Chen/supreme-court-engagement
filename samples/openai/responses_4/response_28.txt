Official Citation: 360 U.S. 185

{"score": 4, "reasoning": "Substantial engagement. The dissent directly contests the majority’s abstention analysis, arguing no clear abuse of discretion and that “exceptional circumstances” exist due to duplication, forum-splitting, comity concerns, and the practical consequences of §2283 (race of forums). It responds to the majority’s core points on comity and the impact on the pending state proceeding, and reframes the majority’s rationale about abandoning injunctive relief. However, it does not fully grapple with the majority’s extensive precedent and Rule 71A history endorsing federal adjudication of state eminent domain issues, and it partly shifts to prudential and merits-based points. Hence, strong but not exhaustive engagement."}
