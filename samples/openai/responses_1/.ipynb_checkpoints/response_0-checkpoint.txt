Official Citation: 448 U.S. 98

{"score": 5, "reasoning": "Strong engagement. The dissent directly contests the majority’s core holdings: (1) It squarely challenges the majority’s Rakas-based expectation-of-privacy framework, arguing instead that possessory/property interests in the seized items themselves confer Fourth Amendment protection, and it rebuts the majority with detailed precedent (Jeffers, Jones, Simmons) and even Rakas’s own language. (2) On the fruit/attenuation issue, it disputes the majority’s characterization of the admissions as “spontaneous,” ties them causally to the illegal detention and search, and argues suppression is required, effectively engaging the majority’s Brown v. Illinois analysis (even if not cited by name). The dissent’s failure to address the search-incident-to-arrest point is derivative of its suppression position. Overall, it talks with—not past—the majority."}
