Official Citation: 365 U.S. 167

{"score": 5, "reasoning": "The dissent directly engages the majority’s core holding on the meaning of “under color of” state law under §1983, using the same statutory text, legislative history, and precedents (Classic, Screws, Williams, Civil Rights Cases) to argue for a narrower construction. It critiques the majority’s historical inferences, addresses stare decisis, agrees on rejecting Screws’ specific-intent gloss for civil suits, and concurs on no municipal liability, while parsing the complaint to concede that the alleged ‘custom’ of incommunicado detentions might satisfy the statute. This is a thorough, point-by-point rebuttal within the same legal framework, reflecting strong dialogue rather than talking past the majority."}
