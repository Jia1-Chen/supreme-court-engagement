Official Citation: 452 U.S. 61

{"score": 3, "reasoning": "The dissent engages some core points but largely reframes the case. It disputes the majority’s characterization of the ordinance as a blanket ban on live entertainment, insisting on an as-applied focus on nude dancing, and relies on Young v. American Mini Theatres to argue minimal intrusion and permissible zoning. However, it mostly sidesteps the majority’s narrow-tailoring and overbreadth analysis, the requirement for evidence justifying the exclusion, and the need for alternative channels within the jurisdiction (not merely nearby cities). The dissent emphasizes local autonomy and policy rhetoric rather than directly rebutting the majority’s detailed First Amendment framework, yielding moderate, not thorough, engagement."}
