Official Citation: 437 U.S. 298

{"score": 4, "reasoning": "The dissent directly contests the majority’s core holding, engaging the same key precedents (Donaldson and Powell) and arguing for a bright-line, pre-referral rule without an “institutional good faith” inquiry. It addresses the majority’s concern about subjective agent purpose and counters that the new institutional test is unworkable and extra-statutory, aligning with Judge Friendly’s Morgan Guaranty reading. However, it does not fully grapple with the majority’s detailed statutory/textual rationale that §7602’s enumerated purposes exclude purely criminal use or with the majority’s legislative-history and institutional-structure analysis. Thus, substantial but not comprehensive engagement."}
