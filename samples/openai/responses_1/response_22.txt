{"score": 5, "reasoning": "Strong engagement. The dissent directly addresses the majority’s core reasoning that Jones Act/FELA liability without negligence extends to violations of any statute, not just the Safety Appliance and Boiler Inspection Acts. It counters by arguing those FELA doctrines rest on specific congressional intent and statutory cross-references unique to those Acts, analyzes §§ 1, 3, and 4 of FELA, and the Coast Guard statute (§§ 157–158), and contends the common-law Gorris v. Scott limitation should apply. It discusses and distinguishes the same precedents (Layton, Gotschall, Davis, Swinson, Coray, Urie, O’Donnell, Carter, Wagner), and challenges the majority’s broader view of evolving FELA duties. This is a detailed, point-by-point rebuttal rather than talking past the majority."}
