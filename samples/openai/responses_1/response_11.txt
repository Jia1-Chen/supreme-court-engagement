Official Citation: 467 U.S. 380

{"score": 4, "reasoning": "The dissent directly engages the majority’s core reasoning. It squarely rebuts the majority’s quantity/quality distinction under §5(d)(1)(B), argues that interruptibility affects the ‘amount’ of power, contests reliance on deference, and interprets §5(d)(1)(A) as about reserves rather than altering DSI entitlements. It responds to the majority’s use of legislative history (including the same Senate Report passage) and addresses the second-quartile issue. However, it does not fully confront some key majority points—most notably the argument that preference rules do not apply to statutorily mandated initial contracts and the §5(g)(7) “deemed sufficient resources” rationale—so engagement, while substantial, is not complete."}
