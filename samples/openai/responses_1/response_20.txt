{"score": 5, "reasoning": "Strong engagement. The dissent accepts the majority’s legal standards on key points (agrees with Parts I, II-A on the materiality test and III-A on no materiality requirement for §1101(f)(6)), but disputes their application and resolves the open questions the majority remands. It directly addresses the same statutes (§1451(a), §1101(f)(6), §1427) and precedents (Chaunt, Fedorenko), argues why visa-stage misrepresentations should count, contests the majority’s limitation of materiality to the true fact rather than the discrepancy-triggered investigation, and argues that the ‘testimony’ and ‘purpose to obtain benefits’ elements are satisfied as a matter of law. This is a detailed rebuttal engaging the majority’s reasoning rather than talking past it."}
