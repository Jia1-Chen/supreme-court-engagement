Official Citation: 478 U.S. 597

{"score": 5, "reasoning": "Strong engagement. The dissent directly rebuts the majority’s textual reading by focusing on the meaning of “damage” versus “damages,” arguing that in 1928 “damage” referred to property harm, not personal injury, and criticizing the majority’s reliance on authorities defining “damages.” It engages the same statutory text (§702c), the same legislative history, and the placement of the immunity sentence alongside the proviso, countering the majority’s point about different sponsors and asserting they were considered as a package. It addresses the FTCA context (sovereign immunity in 1928) and precedent, disputing the majority’s characterization of prior decisions. Although it raises broader policy concerns, its core analysis responds point-by-point to the majority’s reasoning."}
