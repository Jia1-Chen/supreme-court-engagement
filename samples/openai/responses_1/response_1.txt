Official Citation: 400 U.S. 18

{"score": 3, "reasoning": "Moderate engagement. The dissent directly addresses the majority’s reliance on Segal v. Rochelle and Local Loan Co. v. Hunt, arguing those precedents support the trustee rather than the bankrupt, and questions the majority’s conclusion that they compel the opposite result. However, it largely pivots to procedural concerns (summary disposition, unclear record, unresolved California law) and does not substantively engage the majority’s wage-protection and fresh-start policy analysis (e.g., Sniadach, Consumer Credit Protection Act). Thus it responds to some key points but also talks past significant parts of the majority’s reasoning."}
