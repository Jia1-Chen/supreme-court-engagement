Official Citation: 384 U.S. 238

{"score": 5, "reasoning": "The dissent directly confronts the majority’s core holding that courts may authorize “reasonably necessary” deviations from §2 Seventh during a strike. It anchors its argument in the same statutory provisions (§2 Seventh, §§5, 6), rebuts the majority’s public-duty and self-help rationale, emphasizes Congress’s rejection of compulsory arbitration, and cites overlapping precedents (e.g., Steele, Burley). The dissent’s critique is a point-by-point statutory and policy rebuttal rather than a shift to unrelated issues, reflecting strong engagement."}
