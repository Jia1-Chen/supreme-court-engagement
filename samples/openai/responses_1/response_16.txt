Official Citation: 455 U.S. 586

{"score": 5, "reasoning": "The dissent directly engages the majority’s two core points. First, it confronts the majority’s reliance on Ross v. Moffitt by arguing Ross was wrongly decided and should recognize a right to counsel for discretionary review. Second, accepting Ross arguendo, it addresses the majority’s due process/state-action rationale head-on, citing Cuyler v. Sullivan to argue sufficient state involvement and proposing a specific remedy (considering untimely applications when reliance is shown). It uses the same key precedents (Ross, Cuyler) and responds to the majority’s reasoning rather than shifting to unrelated issues."}
