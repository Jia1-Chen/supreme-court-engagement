Official Citation: 524 U.S. 569

{"score": 5, "reasoning": "Strong engagement. The dissent squarely confronts the majority’s key points: it argues the statute is inherently viewpoint-based (contradicting the majority’s hortatory reading), rejects the panel-diversity implementation, and contends that even mere 'consideration' of decency/respect is unconstitutional. It directly answers the majority’s Rosenberger distinction (competition/scarcity), parses Rust’s government-as-speaker rationale, and develops the facial overbreadth framework against the majority’s facial-validity approach. It also addresses permissible applications and the chilling effect, and agrees (narrowly) on vagueness. The dissent cites the same core precedents and legislative history, offering detailed rebuttals throughout."}
