Official Citation: 360 U.S. 185

{"score": 4, "reasoning": "The dissent directly engages the majority’s abstention analysis, disputing the absence of “exceptional circumstances,” emphasizing comity, case-management concerns, forum-splitting, and the practical effects of § 2283 (no injunction, risking parallel races). It rebuts the majority’s view that comity is satisfied if the federal court acts like a state court by stressing the impossibility of consolidating proceedings across systems. However, it does not meaningfully grapple with the majority’s extensive precedent on federal adjudication of state eminent domain issues, Rule 71A, or the in rem argument, and it leans on practical delay and ‘frivolousness’ points. Hence, substantial but not exhaustive engagement."}
