Official Citation: 138 S. Ct. 2105

{"score": 5, "reasoning": "The dissent directly engages the majority’s reasoning point-by-point. It contests the majority’s plain-text reading, focusing on the meaning of “under” in §1229b(d)(1), the cross-reference to §1229(a) versus §1229(a)(1), and whether §1229(a)(1) is definitional or about completeness. It addresses the majority’s reliance on §1229(a)(2) (change of time/place) and §1229(b)(1) (10-day counsel provision), arguing why those provisions do not control the stop-time trigger. It responds to the majority’s “common sense” rationale, offers competing practical considerations, and adds statutory history (orders to show cause) and Chevron deference. The dissent cites the same statutory provisions and precedents, quotes the majority, and provides detailed rebuttals, reflecting strong engagement rather than talking past the majority."}
