Official Citation: 355 U.S. 225

{"score": 4, "reasoning": "The dissent substantially engages the majority’s core reasoning. It directly challenges the majority’s due process rule hinging on passive nonfeasance, rejects drawing a constitutional line between omissions and acts, and invokes the same strict-liability precedents (e.g., Balint) while responding to the Holmes passage the majority quotes. However, it does not fully grapple with the majority’s specific notice-based framework (Mullane/Covey/Walker), the requirement of actual or probable knowledge, or the ordinance’s lack of opportunity to comply. Hence, strong but not exhaustive engagement."}
