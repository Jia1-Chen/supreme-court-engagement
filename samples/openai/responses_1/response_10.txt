Official Citation: 424 U.S. 507

{"score": 5, "reasoning": "The dissent directly engages the majority’s core moves: it challenges the majority’s decision to reach the First Amendment question (invoking constitutional-avoidance principles), disputes the majority’s reading of Lloyd as overruling Logan Valley, and offers a detailed reconciliation of Lloyd, Logan Valley, Central Hardware, and Marsh. It also addresses the statutory framework the majority identifies (Babcock & Wilcox, Republic Aviation) and applies it to the facts, explaining why §7 protects the picketing. The dissent cites the same precedents and squarely rebuts the majority’s constitutional and procedural reasoning, reflecting strong dialogue rather than talking past."}
