Official Citation: 549 U.S. 47

{"score": 5, "reasoning": "Strong engagement. The dissent directly contests the majority’s core interpretive move (“as a felony” implicit in §924(c)(2)), focuses on the same statutory phrases (§924(c)(2), §924(c)(1)(A), 8 U.S.C. §1101(a)(43)’s penultimate sentence), and uses overlapping canons (plain meaning, surplusage) and cases (e.g., Gonzales on “any”). It responds to the majority’s reliance on ordinary meaning of “illicit trafficking” by invoking the statutory cross-reference definition and CSA possession felonies, addresses the majority’s uniformity/anomaly concerns with counter-anomalies, and grapples with the CSA’s own “felony” definition and the majority’s treatment of it. This is a point-by-point textual and structural rebuttal rather than a shift to a different framework."}
