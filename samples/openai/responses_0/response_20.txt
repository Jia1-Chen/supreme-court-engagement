Official Citation: 485 U.S. 759

{"score": 5, "reasoning": "The dissent squarely engages the majority’s core analyses. It agrees with the majority’s no-materiality reading of §1101(f)(6) but argues remand is unnecessary because the false statements were oral “testimony” and plainly made to obtain benefits. It contests the majority’s refusal to consider visa-stage misrepresentations under §1451(a), explains why visa proceedings are integral to naturalization, and applies the same “natural tendency to influence” materiality standard while arguing the Court misapplies it by ignoring the significance of the discrepancy itself. The dissent cites and grapples with the same statutes and precedents (Chaunt, Fedorenko) and offers detailed, point-by-point rebuttals. Although it also raises evidentiary issues (the Soviet depositions), its primary reasoning directly addresses the majority’s arguments."}
