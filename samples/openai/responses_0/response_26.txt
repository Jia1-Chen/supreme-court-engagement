Official Citation: 511 U.S. 809

{"score": 5, "reasoning": "The dissent directly engages the majority’s core reasoning on litigation-related attorney’s fees under CERCLA §107, addressing each of the majority’s three arguments: (1) it contests the majority’s characterization of §107 as only implicitly authorizing a private right of action; (2) it rebuts the negative inference drawn from other SARA fee-shifting provisions; and (3) it offers a competing textual reading of “enforcement activities” that includes private cost-recovery actions and thus attorney’s fees. It cites the same statutes and precedents (Alyeska/Runyon) and even responds to the majority’s footnote on “A shall be liable” language. Although it focuses on litigation fees and not the PRP-search/negotiation fee distinctions, it thoroughly engages the principal disputed issue, reflecting strong dialogue with the majority."}
