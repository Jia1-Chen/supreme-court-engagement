{"score": 5, "reasoning": "Strong engagement. The dissent directly confronts the majority’s core premise that seizure is defined by common-law arrest, arguing instead that Katz and Terry broadened the term. It squarely contests the majority’s treatment of the Mendenhall ‘reasonable person’ test as necessary but not sufficient, citing Mendenhall, Delgado, Royer, and Chesternut to show prior doctrine. It addresses the majority’s reliance on Brower and Hester, distinguishes them, and invokes Garner to discuss use-of-force scenarios. The dissent repeatedly references the majority’s points (including footnotes) and offers policy-based rebuttals about deterrence and timing. Overall, it provides a detailed, point-by-point rejoinder using the same precedents and the same legal question."}
