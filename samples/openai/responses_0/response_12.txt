Official Citation: 512 U.S. 849

{"score": 5, "reasoning": "The dissent directly engages the majority’s core statutory interpretations of §848(q)(4)(B) and §2251, arguing that both require a habeas proceeding to begin only upon filing an application, and controverts the majority’s contrary view that a motion for counsel suffices. It rebuts the majority’s reliance on §848(q)(9) as a textual basis for preapplication counsel, and counters the majority’s policy arguments by pointing to alternative funding and exhaustion expectations. It reads the same statutes in pari materia but in the opposite direction (from the habeas statute to §848), and accuses the majority of bootstrapping and sub silentio amendment. The dissent cites the same legal framework (28 U.S.C. §§ 2241, 2251, 2254, Habeas Rules) and relevant precedents, offering a detailed, point-by-point rebuttal."}
