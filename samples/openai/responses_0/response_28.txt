Official Citation: 360 U.S. 185

{"score": 4, "reasoning": "The dissent substantially engages the majority’s abstention analysis. It contests the majority’s conclusion that no exceptional circumstances exist, emphasizing case-splitting, delay, comity, and the risk of parallel proceedings—directly responding to the majority’s points about comity and Section 2283. It frames the issue as an abuse-of-discretion question and argues the trial court acted within its discretion. However, it does not meaningfully grapple with the majority’s extensive precedent on federal adjudication of state eminent domain matters (Rule 71A and historical cases) and adds merits-based assertions (calling the claim frivolous) that do not address the majority’s core legal reasoning. Hence, substantial but not thorough engagement."}
