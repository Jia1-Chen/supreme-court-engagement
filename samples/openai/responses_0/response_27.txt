Official Citation: 478 U.S. 597

{"score": 4, "reasoning": "The dissent substantially engages the majority’s reasoning. It directly contests the majority’s plain-meaning analysis by distinguishing “damage” (property harm) from “damages” (monetary remedy), cites many of the same interpretive sources (American Stevedores, Dalehite, Sponenbarger), and offers a structural reading of §702c alongside legislative history to rebut the majority’s broad construction. It also specifically answers the majority’s point about the immunity sentence and proviso being separately sponsored by showing they were adopted as a package. However, the dissent does not fully engage some majority points (e.g., the breadth of “flood”/“flood waters,” and the characterization of warning duties as project management), and introduces additional limits (e.g., tying §702c to the 1928 Act’s projects) without extensive engagement with the majority’s contrary authorities. Hence, substantial but not exhaustive engagement."}
