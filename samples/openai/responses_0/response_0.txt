Official Citation: 448 U.S. 98

{"score": 4, "reasoning": "The dissent substantially engages the majority on the two core issues. It directly contests the majority’s Rakas-based expectation-of-privacy analysis by arguing that a possessory interest in the seized items suffices under Jeffers, Jones, and Simmons, and it critiques the majority’s reading of Rakas with citations to the same authorities. It also engages the attenuation issue, disputing the majority’s characterization of the admission as “spontaneous” and tying it causally to the assumed illegal detention and illegal search. While the dissent does not walk through each Brown factor in detail and adds broader normative and historical arguments, it meaningfully responds to the majority’s reasoning and precedents. Hence, substantial but not exhaustive engagement."}
