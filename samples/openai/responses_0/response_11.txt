Official Citation: 467 U.S. 380

{"score": 4, "reasoning": "The dissent substantially engages the majority’s reasoning. It directly rebuts the majority’s core quantity/quality distinction under §5(d)(1)(B), analyzes the same provisions (§5(d)(1)(B), §5(d)(1)(A), and §3(17)), contests the majority’s use of legislative history (including the Senate Report passage), and challenges the deference rationale by citing precedent and pointing to BPA’s inconsistent positions. It also answers the majority’s policy/rate-exchange discussion. However, it engages less directly with the majority’s argument that the initial DSI contracts are statutorily allocated and therefore outside the preference regime, and it does not address §5(g)(7). Thus, significant but not complete engagement."}
