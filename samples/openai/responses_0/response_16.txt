Official Citation: 455 U.S. 586

{"score": 5, "reasoning": "The dissent squarely engages the majority’s two core points. It challenges the majority’s reliance on Ross v. Moffitt by arguing Ross was wrongly decided and that counsel is constitutionally required for discretionary appeals. It then offers an alternative due process theory even if Ross stands, directly addressing the majority’s state-action rationale by invoking Cuyler v. Sullivan and extending its logic to post-trial proceedings. The dissent cites the same precedents, responds to the majority’s reasoning, and proposes a concrete remedy, reflecting thorough, point-by-point engagement."}
