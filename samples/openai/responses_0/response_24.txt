Official Citation: 384 U.S. 238

{"score": 5, "reasoning": "The dissent directly engages the majority’s core reasoning under § 2 Seventh of the Railway Labor Act, disputing the majority’s creation of a court-supervised “reasonably necessary” exception after exhaustion and strike. It addresses the same statutory provisions (§§ 2 Seventh, 5, 6), acknowledges self-help, and rebuts the majority’s reliance on public-service considerations by noting there is no absolute duty to operate. It critiques the shift from bargaining with the union to bargaining with courts, invokes the same precedents (e.g., Steele), and raises structural concerns about judicial intervention vis-à-vis the Act’s scheme. This is a thorough, point-by-point statutory and doctrinal rebuttal, indicating strong engagement."}
