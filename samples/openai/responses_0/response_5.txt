{"score": 4, "reasoning": "The dissent engages substantially with the majority’s reasoning. It directly challenges the Sixth Amendment fair-cross-section framework, disputes the majority’s characterization of 15% female venires as “exclusion,” critiques the burden/justification standard as a disguised equal protection test, and responds to the majority’s reliance on Taylor and its dicta about tailored exemptions. However, it focuses more on recharacterizing the constitutional basis and policy consequences than on refuting the majority’s specific three-part test application and statistical showing, so the engagement, while significant, is not comprehensive."}
