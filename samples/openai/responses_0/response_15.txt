Official Citation: 138 S. Ct. 2105

{"score": 5, "reasoning": "The dissent directly and repeatedly engages the majority’s reasoning. It addresses the same statutory provisions (§§ 1229(a)(1), (a)(2), (b)(1), 1229b(d)(1)), disputes the majority’s definitional reading of §1229(a)(1), contests the meaning of “under” in the stop-time rule, responds to the majority’s reliance on paragraph (2) and §1229(b)(1), and counters the majority’s “common sense” framing by advancing an alternative (charging-document) view. It also presents statutory history (orders to show cause) and practical consequences, while invoking and applying Chevron as the governing framework. The dissent cites the same cases and even responds to specific points and footnotes. This is a detailed, point-by-point rebuttal, i.e., strong engagement."}
