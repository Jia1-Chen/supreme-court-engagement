Official Citation: 400 U.S. 18

{"score": 3, "reasoning": "Moderate engagement. The dissent directly contests the majority’s reliance on Segal and Local Loan and challenges the ‘fresh start’ rationale with the “head start” point, showing some dialogue on the core precedents and policy. But it largely pivots to procedural concerns (summary disposition, unclear record, unresolved California law) and does not substantively grapple with the majority’s wage-protection rationale (Sniadach, CCPA) or apply the ‘sufficiently rooted’ test in detail. As a result, it talks with the majority on some key points but also talks past it in significant respects."}
