{"score": 3, "reasoning": "Moderate engagement. The dissent directly contests the majority’s framing (facial ban on all live entertainment) by recasting the case as an as-applied challenge to nude dancing, and it invokes Berman, Belle Terre, and Young to defend broad local zoning discretion and minimal intrusion. It also responds (albeit briefly) to the alternative-channels point by emphasizing nearby cities. But it largely sidesteps the majority’s core First Amendment analysis—overbreadth, narrow tailoring, evidence of secondary effects, and the requirement that alternatives exist within the jurisdiction—offering little engagement with Grayned, Schneider, or the majority’s distinction of Young. As a result, it talks with the majority on framing and general authority, but talks past it on the key doctrinal tests and evidentiary demands."}
