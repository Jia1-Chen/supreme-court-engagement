Official Citation: 549 U.S. 47

{"score": 5, "reasoning": "Strong engagement. The dissent squarely addresses the majority’s core textual reading of “felony punishable under the CSA,” rejects the implied “as a felony” gloss, and argues from the same provisions (18 U.S.C. §924(c)(2), §924(c)(1)(A), 8 U.S.C. §1101(a)(43), and the INA’s penultimate sentence). It responds to the majority’s ordinary-meaning argument about “illicit trafficking,” the Russello inference about state-law references, the CSA’s “felony” definition, and the superfluity concern tied to §924(c)(1)(A)’s “may be prosecuted” clause. It also engages the majority’s anomaly arguments (marijuana quantity and cocaine base scenarios) and offers counter-anomalies. While it adds some broader points, the dissent is primarily a detailed rebuttal of the majority’s reasoning using the same statutory framework and canons."}
