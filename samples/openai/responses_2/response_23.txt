{"score": 5, "reasoning": "The dissent directly engages the majority’s reasoning point by point. It contests the majority’s core conclusions that §954(d)(1) is not viewpoint-based, that the ‘consideration’ language is merely hortatory, that the subsidy/competitive context (and Rust) permit the criteria, and that facial invalidation is inappropriate. It counters the majority’s Rosenberger distinction (competition vs. scarcity), rejects the panel-diversity implementation the majority entertains, and addresses facial overbreadth versus the majority’s heavy-burden framing. Both opinions analyze the same statutory text and legislative history and cite the same key precedents (Rosenberger, Rust, Regan, Lamb’s Chapel, Leathers, R.A.V., Pacifica, Reno). The dissent even concurs on vagueness while explaining why overbreadth applies. This is thorough, case-specific rebuttal demonstrating strong dialogue."}
