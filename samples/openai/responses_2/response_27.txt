Official Citation: 478 U.S. 597

{"score": 5, "reasoning": "Strong engagement. The dissent directly rebuts the majority’s textual analysis by arguing that “damage” (not “damages”) in 1928 meant property harm, not personal injury, and critiques the majority’s reliance on authorities defining “damages.” It engages the same statutory text and structure (linking the immunity sentence to the §3 proviso), and addresses the same legislative history, disputing the majority’s reading (including the sponsorship point) and emphasizing the absence of any discussion of personal injuries. It also confronts the FTCA interplay and cites many of the same cases (e.g., American Stevedores, Sponenbarger, Dalehite), offering a detailed counter-interpretation rather than shifting to a separate framework."}
