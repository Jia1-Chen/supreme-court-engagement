Official Citation: 355 U.S. 225

{"score": 4, "reasoning": "Substantial engagement. The dissent directly contests the majority’s core due process rationale by rejecting a constitutional distinction between passive nonfeasance (failure to register) and affirmative acts, and by invoking the long line of strict-liability regulatory cases (e.g., Balint) that the majority cites and distinguishes. It also engages the same Holmes passage the majority relies on, arguing the majority misuses it. However, the dissent does not fully grapple with the majority’s specific notice-based precedents (e.g., Mullane) or the majority’s emphasis on lack of circumstances alerting the defendant, and it largely dismisses rather than systematically rebuts those points, keeping it short of full, point-by-point engagement."}
