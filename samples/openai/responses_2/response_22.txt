Official Citation: 355 U.S. 426

{"score": 5, "reasoning": "Strong engagement. The dissent squarely addresses the majority’s core move—extending FELA’s strict-liability precedents (Safety Appliance and Boiler Inspection Acts) to a Coast Guard navigation rule under the Jones Act. It cites and analyzes the same cases (Layton, Gotschall, Davis, Swinson, Coray, Urie, O’Donnell, Carter, Wagner), disputes the majority’s reading of §1 and §4 of the FELA, and argues from statutory text and purpose (33 U.S.C. §§157–158, CFR §80.16(h)) that absolute liability was uniquely tied to those safety statutes and legislative intent, not to all statutory violations. It also directly challenges the majority’s broader reconception of negligence under the FELA/Jones Act. This is a detailed, point-by-point rebuttal rather than a shift to unrelated issues."}
