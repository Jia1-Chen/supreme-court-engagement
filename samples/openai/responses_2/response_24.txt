Official Citation: 384 U.S. 238

{"score": 4, "reasoning": "Substantial engagement. The dissent directly contests the majority’s core statutory interpretation of § 2 Seventh, rejects the court-created “reasonably necessary” exception, and responds to the majority’s duty-to-operate and self-help rationale. It cites some of the same authorities (e.g., Steele; Elgin) and argues Congress did not authorize judicial supervision of contract changes. However, it does not fully grapple with the majority’s limiting standard, supervisory framework, or the Interstate Commerce Act-based public duty in detail, leaning instead on broader institutional and policy critiques."}
