Official Citation: 439 U.S. 357

{"score": 3, "reasoning": "The dissent engages the majority’s core framework only at a high level, arguing the Sixth Amendment fair‑cross‑section test is really equal protection in disguise and criticizing the majority’s use of “exclusion,” its “significant state interest” standard, and dicta about exemptions. It cites and quotes specific passages. But it largely sidesteps the majority’s three‑prong prima facie test and burden‑shifting, does not contest the statistics or the finding of systematic underrepresentation, and offers no substantive justification for Missouri’s exemption. Much of the dissent pivots to broader policy critiques and remedial concerns, rather than directly rebutting the majority’s application to the facts. Hence moderate engagement."}
