{"score": 4, "reasoning": "The dissent substantially engages the majority’s core reasoning. It contests the majority’s reading of Donaldson and Powell, argues for a bright-line 'pre-referral' rule, and directly attacks the majority’s new 'institutional good faith' requirement as unworkable. It cites the same key precedents (Donaldson, Powell, Reisman) and aligns with Judge Friendly’s Morgan Guaranty approach. However, it does not deeply grapple with the majority’s statutory-text/legislative-history argument that §7602’s enumerated purposes are inherently civil and thus exclude exclusively criminal use, offering more assertion than detailed textual rebuttal. Hence, strong but not exhaustive engagement."}
