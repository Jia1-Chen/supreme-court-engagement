Official Citation: 535 U.S. 789

{"score": 4, "reasoning": "The dissent directly engages the majority’s core holding that §406(b) does not displace contingent-fee agreements and should be reviewed for reasonableness. Scalia critiques the majority’s hybrid approach (presumptive contingent fee adjusted by lodestar-type factors), argues for a lodestar-only interpretation of “reasonable fee,” and responds to specific points: the 1965 enactment timing, the analogy to §406(a) fee agreements, and the treatment of delay/windfalls. He cites overlapping precedents (Hensley, Dague) and uses “ante, at” references throughout. While he does not address every historical and statutory nuance the majority raises (e.g., EAJA interplay, broader legislative history), his rebuttal is substantial and focused on the same legal question, warranting a 4 rather than a 5."}
