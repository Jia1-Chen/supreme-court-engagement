Official Citation: 424 U.S. 507

{"score": 5, "reasoning": "Strong engagement. The dissent directly confronts the majority’s two core moves: (1) reaching and resolving the constitutional question by declaring the First Amendment inapplicable and effectively overruling Logan Valley, and (2) remanding on statutory grounds. It argues for constitutional avoidance, then applies the same statutory framework (Babcock & Wilcox) to conclude §7 protection exists. On the constitutional merits, it squarely rebuts the majority’s reading of Lloyd as having displaced Logan Valley, engaging deeply with the same precedents—Marsh, Logan Valley, Lloyd, Central Hardware—and even addresses the majority’s content-discrimination point (citing Mosley). The dissent’s analysis is a detailed, point-by-point rejoinder using the same authorities and legal standards."}
