Official Citation: 420 U.S. 592

{"score": 5, "reasoning": "The dissent directly engages the majority’s two central holdings: (1) extending Younger to state civil nuisance actions “in aid of” criminal laws, and (2) requiring exhaustion of state appellate remedies before a §1983 suit. It rebuts the majority’s comity/federalism rationale by contrasting the criminal-context equity tradition with the historically different treatment of civil proceedings and the Anti-Injunction Act, and warns of strategic state civil filings to block federal forums. It squarely contests the exhaustion requirement as incompatible with Monroe v. Pape and undercuts the majority’s treatment of Mitchum v. Foster and §2283. The dissent cites and analyzes many of the same precedents (Younger, Fenner, Douglas v. Jeannette, Dombrowski, Mitchum, Steffel, Zwickler, England) and addresses the procedural posture (Sosna) and abstention alternatives. While it does not delve into the Ohio statute’s later narrowing, that issue is ancillary to the threshold Younger question. Overall, the dissent is in sustained dialogue with the majority’s reasoning."}
