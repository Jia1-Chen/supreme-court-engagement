Official Citation: 360 U.S. 185

{"score": 4, "reasoning": "The dissent substantially engages the majority’s core reasoning on abstention. It contests the majority’s conclusion that no “exceptional circumstances” or comity concerns exist, emphasizing practical friction, duplicative litigation, and the risk of a race between forums given §2283’s bar on injunctions. It responds directly to the majority’s points about the abandonment of injunctive relief, the separability of validity and damages under Pennsylvania law, and the propriety of proceeding in federal court. However, it does not grapple in detail with the majority’s extensive precedent on federal adjudication of state eminent domain issues (e.g., Rule 71A, Boom Co., Kline), focusing instead on case-specific efficiency and comity, which slightly reduces the depth of engagement."}
