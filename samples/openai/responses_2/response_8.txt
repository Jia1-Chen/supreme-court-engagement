{"score": 4, "reasoning": "The dissent substantially engages the majority’s core constitutional reasoning. It directly confronts the majority’s reliance on Maryland v. Wirtz and United States v. California, argues why those precedents are flawed or should be limited/overruled, and develops a Tenth Amendment/federalism-based rebuttal to the Commerce Clause rationale, including responses to the Supremacy Clause framing and the “emergency” justification. It cites many of the same precedents (Wirtz, California, Wickard, Heart of Atlanta) and contests their application. However, it does not meaningfully address the majority’s statutory-interpretation discussion about congressional intent to include state employees, and it pivots to broader structural concerns and proposed line-drawing, which slightly reduces the depth of engagement.
