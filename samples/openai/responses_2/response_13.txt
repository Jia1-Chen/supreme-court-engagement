Official Citation: 365 U.S. 167

{"score": 5, "reasoning": "The dissent directly engages the majority’s core issue—the meaning of “under color of” state law in §1983—using the same statutory text, legislative history, and key precedents (Classic, Screws, Williams). It contests the majority’s stare decisis rationale, reinterprets the debates behind the 1871 Act, and addresses the same intent issue from Screws, agreeing that specific intent should not be imported into §1983. It also agrees with the majority on municipal non-liability and parses the complaint similarly, acknowledging that alleged departmental customs might qualify even if the warrantless home raid does not. Overall, it provides a thorough, point-by-point rebuttal rather than shifting to unrelated grounds."}
