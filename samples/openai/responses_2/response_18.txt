Official Citation: 549 U.S. 47

{"score": 5, "reasoning": "Strong engagement. The dissent directly contests the majority’s textual reading of “felony punishable under the CSA,” arguing the plain meaning of “any felony” includes state felonies and that the CSA’s punishability element is separate. It responds point-by-point to the majority’s reliance on ordinary meaning of “illicit trafficking,” invoking §1101(a)(43)(B)’s incorporation of §924(c)(2) to show that possession can qualify. It addresses the same statutory provisions (18 U.S.C. §924(c)(2), §924(c)(1)(A), 8 U.S.C. §1101(a)(43)’s penultimate sentence), raises surplusage concerns in light of §924(c)(1)(A)’s “may be prosecuted” clause, and engages the majority’s state-law-variance and anomaly arguments (marijuana example, quantity disparities). It even answers the majority’s footnote points about superfluity and CSA definitions. This is a detailed, statute-by-statute rebuttal, not talking past the majority."}
