Official Citation: 485 U.S. 759

{"score": 4, "reasoning": "The dissent engages closely with the majority’s core issues. It agrees that §1101(f)(6) has no materiality requirement but argues the majority need not remand because the record already shows “testimony” and the requisite purpose. It adopts the majority’s materiality test (“natural tendency to influence”) but disputes its application, directly challenging the majority’s exclusion of visa-stage misrepresentations from §1451(a) and its insistence that only the misrepresented fact itself (not the discrepancy revealing a lie) can be material. The dissent cites the same statutes and precedents (Chaunt, Fedorenko) and offers detailed rebuttals. It does not fully engage the majority’s separate “procured by” causation/presumption framework, focusing instead on alternative grounds to affirm, so the engagement is substantial but not comprehensive."}
