Official Citation: 556 U.S. 332

{"score": 5, "reasoning": "The dissent directly engages the majority’s reasoning on all key points. It contests the majority’s narrow reading of Belton, argues stare decisis with detailed reliance, workability, and changed-circumstances analysis, and responds to the majority’s Chimel-based rationale by offering a competing interpretation (time-of-arrest measure). It also critiques the majority’s two-part rule (the reachability prong and the ‘reasonable to believe’ evidentiary prong), questioning its doctrinal basis and limits. The dissent cites and analyzes the same precedents (Chimel, Belton, Thornton, Dickerson) and addresses the majority’s privacy and safety justifications, demonstrating thorough, point-by-point engagement."}
