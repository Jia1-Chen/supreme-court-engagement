{"score": 4, "reasoning": "The dissent directly engages the majority’s constitutional reasoning, explicitly confronting the majority’s reliance on Maryland v. Wirtz and United States v. California, and offering a detailed Tenth Amendment/federalism rebuttal with alternative limiting principles. It addresses the same core Commerce Clause framework and the emergency rationale. However, it largely bypasses the statutory-intent portion of the majority opinion and broadens the discussion into intergovernmental tax immunity and sovereignty doctrines, making the engagement substantial but not complete."}
