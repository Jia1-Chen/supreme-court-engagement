Official Citation: 437 U.S. 298

{"score": 4, "reasoning": "The dissent directly engages the majority’s core reasoning by disputing its expansion of the good-faith inquiry to an 'institutional' test and by arguing for Donaldson’s bright-line rule (good faith in the Powell sense plus pre-referral) as the only limits. It cites and interprets the same key precedents (Donaldson, Powell, Morgan Guaranty) and challenges the workability and statutory basis of the majority’s added requirements. However, it does not fully grapple with the majority’s statutory-history analysis or its argument that §7602 authorizes only civil tax purposes and thus precludes purely criminal use, offering more assertion than detailed rebuttal on that point. Hence, substantial but not exhaustive engagement."}
