Official Citation: 439 U.S. 357

{"score": 3, "reasoning": "The dissent engages the majority’s core framework mainly to attack it, arguing the fair-cross-section doctrine is an improper Sixth Amendment surrogate for Equal Protection and disputing the use of “exclusion” where women comprise ~15% of venires. It cites and contrasts Taylor, Hoyt, and equal protection cases, and raises the doctrinal and policy consequences of the majority’s “significant state interest” test. But it largely talks past the majority’s specific application: it does not seriously contest the three-prong prima facie test, the statistical showing of underrepresentation and systematic operation, or the State’s failure to justify the opt-out rule. The focus shifts to broader jurisprudential and practical critiques rather than a point-by-point rebuttal, warranting a moderate engagement score."}
