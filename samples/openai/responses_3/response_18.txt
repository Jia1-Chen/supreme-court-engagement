Official Citation: 549 U.S. 47

{"score": 5, "reasoning": "Strong engagement. The dissent directly confronts the majority’s core textual reading of §924(c)(2), arguing against the implied “as a felony” limitation and emphasizing the breadth of “any felony.” It responds to the majority’s Russello/context argument by invoking §924(c)(1)(A)’s “may be prosecuted in a court of the United States” clause to avoid surplusage, and addresses the INA’s penultimate sentence as confirming inclusion of state law. It rebuts the majority’s reliance on the ordinary meaning of “illicit trafficking” by pointing out that §1101(a)(43)(B) itself incorporates §924(c)(2)’s definition (including possession felonies). It engages the majority’s anomaly concerns (e.g., marijuana and state-by-state disparities) and raises counter-anomalies, and even answers the majority’s superfluity point in a footnote. Overall, the dissent tracks the same statutory provisions and offers detailed, point-by-point rebuttals."}
