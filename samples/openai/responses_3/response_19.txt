{"score": 5, "reasoning": "Strong engagement. Both dissents directly confront the majority’s core reasoning. Justice Scalia challenges the majority’s framing (presumption vs. substantial-evidence review), engages the same NLRB cases (Station KKHI, Service Electric, Leveld), and rebuts the majority’s empirical and policy points (replacement-worker interests, post-strike dynamics), even invoking Chenery and APA principles to contest the majority’s deference posture. Justice Blackmun likewise focuses on the Board’s inconsistency with its own precedents and lack of reasoned explanation, addressing the same doctrinal terrain. The dissents cite the same authorities and offer detailed, point-by-point rebuttals, reflecting meaningful dialogue rather than talking past the majority."}
