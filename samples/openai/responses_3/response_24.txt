Official Citation: 384 U.S. 238

{"score": 4, "reasoning": "Substantial engagement. The dissent directly challenges the majority’s central move—implying a court-supervised exception to § 2 Seventh after exhaustion of RLA procedures—and argues from the statute’s text, the structure of the RLA (including the absence of compulsory arbitration), and the union’s continuing representative status. It responds to the majority’s public-duty rationale by emphasizing there is no absolute duty to operate and contends courts cannot authorize changes Congress forbids. While it squarely addresses the same statutory provisions and core reasoning, it does not fully engage each precedent the majority relies on (e.g., B&O self-help and Virginian Ry) or the “reasonably necessary” standard’s application, and introduces broader policy concerns, so the engagement is strong but not exhaustive."}
