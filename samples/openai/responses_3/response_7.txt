Official Citation: 355 U.S. 225

{"score": 4, "reasoning": "Substantial engagement. The dissent directly contests the majority’s core due process rationale, rejecting the active/passive (nonfeasance) distinction and arguing that the Court is improperly constitutionalizing a mens rea requirement. It invokes overlapping strict-liability precedent (e.g., Balint) and responds to the majority’s use of Holmes. It also notes facts (in-state conviction, long residence) relevant to the majority’s notice premise. However, it does not meaningfully grapple with the majority’s specific notice-based authorities (e.g., Mullane line) or the majority’s “actual or probable knowledge” standard, making the engagement significant but not comprehensive."}
