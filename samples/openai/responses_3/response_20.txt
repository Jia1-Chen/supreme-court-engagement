Official Citation: 485 U.S. 759

{"score": 5, "reasoning": "The dissent directly engages the majority’s core holdings on both issues: (1) materiality under §1451(a) and its application, and (2) whether §1101(f)(6) requires materiality and whether remand is needed on “testimony” and intent. Justice White accepts the majority’s materiality standard but disputes its limitation to misstatements made only in the naturalization proceeding and its insistence that materiality turn solely on the misrepresented fact rather than also on the fact of the lie and resultant discrepancy. He uses the same precedents (Chaunt, Fedorenko, Costello) and statutory provisions, and offers record-based reasons to find materiality. On §1101(f)(6), he agrees no materiality is required but argues the record conclusively establishes “testimony” and purpose, directly rebutting the majority’s remand rationale. This is substantial, point-by-point engagement rather than talking past the majority."}
