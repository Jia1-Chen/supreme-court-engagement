Official Citation: 140 S. Ct. 1308

{"score": 4, "reasoning": "The dissent expressly accepts the majority’s conclusions on Parts I–III (obligation and no implied repeal) and focuses its disagreement on Part IV (the Tucker Act remedy). It directly challenges the majority’s ‘money‑mandating’/fair‑interpretation framework, arguing inconsistency with modern implied-right-of-action jurisprudence (Sandoval, Comcast, Hernández) and questioning the doctrinal basis of Testan/White Mountain Apache/Bormes/Bowen. While it introduces broader concerns and calls for reargument rather than fully engaging every application detail, it substantially engages the core remedial issue the majority relies on, citing and contesting the same line of precedents. This is significant engagement, though not exhaustive across all issues."}
