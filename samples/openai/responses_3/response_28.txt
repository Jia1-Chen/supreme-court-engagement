Official Citation: 360 U.S. 185

{"score": 4, "reasoning": "The dissent substantially engages the majority’s core reasoning on abstention. It argues there were “exceptional circumstances,” focuses on comity and orderly administration, and directly addresses the majority’s treatment of § 2283 and the split proceedings problem. It also contests the majority’s assurance that comity is satisfied and highlights the risk of parallel litigation and a race of forums. However, it does not fully grapple with the majority’s extensive precedent and Rule 71A discussion endorsing federal adjudication of state eminent domain issues, nor does it directly refute the majority’s acceptance of the Third Circuit’s reading of Pennsylvania procedure. Hence, strong but not comprehensive engagement."}
