Official Citation: 420 U.S. 592

{"score": 4, "reasoning": "The dissent directly engages the majority’s core move—extending Younger abstention to state civil proceedings and requiring exhaustion of state appellate remedies—by arguing this departs from tradition, conflicts with Monroe v. Pape, and undermines Mitchum v. Foster and Congress’s stance on the Anti-Injunction Act. It cites and analyzes many of the same precedents (Younger, Fenner, Stefanelli, Dombrowski, Mitchum, Monroe) and contests the majority’s comity/federalism rationale as misapplied to civil cases. However, it does not grapple with some of the majority’s more specific points (e.g., the ‘pending through appeal’ conception, the tailored exceptions to Younger, the Ohio ‘Without a Stitch’ narrowing, or the habeas fallback distinction), so the engagement is substantial but not comprehensive."}
