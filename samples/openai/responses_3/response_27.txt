Official Citation: 478 U.S. 597

{"score": 5, "reasoning": "Strong engagement. The dissent directly rebuts the majority’s plain-meaning approach by arguing that “damage” in 1928 meant property damage (not personal injury), distinguishing “damage” from “damages” and even using the same sources (e.g., American Stevedores) to show the difference. It contests the majority’s legislative-history reading by tying the immunity sentence to the proviso in §702c, cites the Congressional Record to refute the majority’s sponsorship/severability point, and argues that the 1928 Act’s context (pre-FTCA sovereign immunity) undercuts the majority’s expansive reading. It also engages the majority’s breadth arguments (scope beyond the Mississippi projects) and highlights the absence of personal injury applications in prior case law. While the dissent advances its own narrower framework, it does so by squarely addressing the majority’s key premises and authorities."}
