Official Citation: 448 U.S. 98

{"score": 4, "reasoning": "The dissent substantially engages the majority on the key issues. It directly challenges the majority’s Rakas-based “legitimate expectation of privacy” framework, arguing instead (with citations to Jeffers, Jones, Simmons, and the Fourth Amendment’s text) that a possessory interest in the items seized suffices to invoke Fourth Amendment protection. It also contests the majority’s attenuation analysis, disputing the claim that Rawlings’s admission was “spontaneous” and asserting a direct causal chain from the unlawful detention and search, while noting the lack of a developed record and urging remand. However, the dissent does not fully grapple with the majority’s fact-specific privacy analysis (e.g., Rawlings’s lack of access to the purse, others’ access, his own admission), does not walk through the Brown v. Illinois factors in detail, and does not separately address the search-incident-to-arrest reasoning. Hence, strong but not exhaustive engagement."}
